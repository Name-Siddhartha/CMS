Make generic classes for the webpage

Major parts of the webpage are the following:

1. Header
	Here we have the logo icon, name and other relevant features that might 
	seem necessary. 	

2. Top Navbar
	a. There have to be a set of predefined links
		i. We will be interacting with the list of entries in the database
		ii. We would have to deal with many data tables
			(or even 1 if we plan it well)
	b. Then we will have the dropdown list to deal with.
		i. Again, we have to define the model.
		ii. This will be relatively easier to do.

3. Left Navbar
	a. We have the quick links
		i. We can go for the redirection of pages (load afresh)
		ii. We can go for hiding the elements and then display them	
		iii. We can chose to go for the iframe model

4. Right Navbar 
	a. If it even exists
		i. Then add the suitable external links
		ii. We should ultimately be aslo able to add a new webpage
